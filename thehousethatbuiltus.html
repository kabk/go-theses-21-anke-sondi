             <p> <i>“Historic elegance. The soft Old White deserves its name because it is the most historic shade of white on the colour chart. He feels just as comfortable in the old building as in the kitchen of a modern single-family house. Old white is part of the Traditional Neutrals range. White and light primer tones.”

             <p>To be able to understand the white all around us <a>–the white of the here and now–</a> is to understand <a>the white that was</a> and how it came to occupy the space. In the same process in which my body came to be shaped by the space it inhabited, spaces are also being shaped by the bodies that inhabit them. Spaces are formed by being orientated around some bodies, more than others.<sup>10</sup> For a space to become white it has to be moulded by the repetitive proximity of white bodies. </p> <br>
               <p><a>The white that was</a> operated in a system of expansion and oppression by which the white body came to occupy more spaces. With the expansion came the reshaping of the spaces through the institutionalisation of white bodies, their ideologies, signs and symbols. The spaces this white came to occupy was not given but taken with violence. The bodies that inhabited these spaces were either recruited or discarded. Recruitment meant to make them part of its institution while neglecting those who do not have access.<sup>11</sup> To be part of an institution is to inhabit its buildings and follow its line. <sup>12</sup> </p> <br>
               <p>One of the prevalent signs installed through the expansion is language: not only as a marker of those belonging to the institution and a tool for recruitment but also as a powerful instrument for demarcation. Through a set of grammar of difference, white placed itself as that which others have to be compared to and judged.<sup>13</sup> With the use of language, the self-proclaimed “developed” white classified the world and put itself in the first position, while placing others as below: as second or third. By taking the highest position in the hierarchy it created, <a>the white that was</a> was able to put in place a set of rules and standards that others have to follow if they ever want to be seen as equal. In contrast to the “developed” white, the others become underdeveloped or in the process of becoming developed. As the self-appointed leader, white then feels entitled to impose its help on others, justifying its expansion as charity. </p> <br>
               <p>This is the white we inherited, the accumulation of past actions that have formed the house that built us. Through processes of expansion, recruitment and demarcation, white came to shape the spaces around us and painted it in its own colour. The violent habitual proximity of white bodies moulded the space and turned it white.</p>

      <p> <i>“Silent friendliness. White in its purest form. If white is to represent its own theme in the room, All White is the right choice. It is a pure white, completely neutral and free of pigments. Use it for the paintwork and ceilings. The wall colours will appear fresher and brighter. All White is a tone from the Modern Neutrals range. White and light primer tones.”

      <p>Through the process of expansion, <a>the white of the here and now</a> has become all-encompassing. It's in every room and every corner. It's a whiteness we’ve inherited from <a>the white that was</a> and our colonial history. <a>The white that was</a> cannot be changed but its effect will always remain in the space we navigate and its expansion, even if more subtle in the now, is still on the rise. <i>Whiteness has become our familiar world, the one we know.</i> <sup>14</sup> Because white is so widespread, it becomes impossible to not be affected by it. We all swim in this sea of whiteness, the difference is while some swim with the current, others are being drowned. To be able to fully inhabit this world, you have to show a sameness to the omnipresent whiteness. Familiarity becomes an important key to feeling like you belong. Important parts of this familiarity are inherited, making some bodies more capable of inhabiting this whiteness, while others are bound to fail. <i>The body-at-home</i> becomes the body that is capable of inhabiting whiteness. <sup>15</sup> In this space we navigate, White is the body-at-home and consequently, it is produced as the host of the house.  </p>
    <br>
      <p>As the body-at-home, white has shaped its surrounding to better fit it’s own image, reinforcing the idea of “others” as unfamiliar. <sup>16</sup> <i>Bodies stand out when they are out of place and such standing re-confirms the whiteness of the space.</i> <sup>17</sup> As a host, white welcomes those who are not at home, the others become the guests, <i>but let us not forget that however warmly welcomed, ultimately a guest is expected to return home again.</i> <sup>18</sup>The way that white positions itself within the space transmutes the rest as the other, the non-white. Against this white background, non-white bodies become exposed and framed. </p>
    <br>
      <p>Through its omnipresence white becomes assumed, which renders it natural and in turn invisible. It forms the unnamed background and functions as the norm from which all is derived. This puts <i>white in the privileged position of being able to see without being seen.</i><sup>19</sup> Inevitably this naturalisation of white is also being shaped through language. Against this normative background, others are being marked and named, while white stays unnamed. This process of naming and marking of the others is found within all levels, even within academic discourses. In the example of my higher education facility “The Royal Academy of Art, the Hague” every year fashion students are given an assignment, to create an “ethnic costume”. The definition of ethnic is <i>relating to or characteristic of a large group of people who have the same national, racial, or cultural origins, and who usually speak the same language.</i> <sup>20</sup> However, as Gloria Wekker remarks in her book “White Innocence” (2014) when ethnicity is invoked in those settings, it is “they”, the others, meaning everything except white. <i>As the more powerful member, it is consistently bracketed and thereby invisibilized and installed as the norm.</i> <sup>21</sup> This commodification of the other can seem like a tempting way to render visible those who have been ignored but in a predominantly white institute that has been shaped by the repetitive approximation of the white bodies that inhabit them, the ethnic costume assignment reinforces the normalcy of white. </p>
    <br>
     <p>
       As the body-at-home, White bodies are comfortable as they inhabit spaces that extend their shape, while simultaneously shaping the space to fit them better. <sup>22</sup> Others become guests, framed by white. The body-at-home takes the powerful position of being the representative of the house and the claim of power to talk for the commonality of the inhabitants.<sup>23</sup> </p>
