        <p> <b>“Historic elegance. The soft Old White deserves its name because it is the most historic shade of white on the colour chart. He feels just as comfortable in the old building as in the kitchen of a modern single-family house. Old white is part of the Traditional Neutrals range. White and light primer tones.”

        <p>To be able to understand the white all around us <a>–the white of the here and now–</a> is to understand <a>the white that was</a> and how it came to occupy the space. In the same process in which my body came to be shaped by the space it inhabited, spaces are also being shaped by the bodies that inhabit them. Spaces are formed by being orientated around some bodies, more than others.<sup>10</sup> For a space to become white it has to be moulded by the repetitive proximity of white bodies. </p> <br>
          <p><a>The white that was</a> operated in a system of expansion and oppression by which the white body came to occupy more spaces. With the expansion came the reshaping of the spaces through the institutionalisation of white bodies, their ideologies, signs and symbols. The spaces this white came to occupy was not given but taken with violence. The bodies that inhabited these spaces were either recruited or discarded. Recruitment meant to make them part of its institution while neglecting those who do not have access.<sup>11</sup> <i>To be part of an institution is to inhabit its buildings and follow its line.</i> <sup>12</sup> </p> <br>
          <p>One of the prevalent signs installed through the expansion is language: not only as a marker of those belonging to the institution and a tool for recruitment but also as a powerful instrument for demarcation. Through a set of <i>grammar of difference</i>, white placed itself as that which others have to be compared to and judged.<sup>13</sup> With the use of language, the self-proclaimed “developed” white classified the world and put itself in the first position, while placing others as below: as second or third. By taking the highest position in the hierarchy it created, <a>the white that was</a> was able to put in place a set of rules and standards that others have to follow if they ever want to be seen as equal. In contrast to the “developed” white, the others become underdeveloped or in the process of becoming developed. As the self-appointed leader, white then feels entitled to impose its help on others, justifying its expansion as charity. </p> <br>
          <p>This is the white we inherited, the accumulation of past actions that have formed the house that built us. Through processes of expansion, recruitment and demarcation, white came to shape the spaces around us and painted it in its own colour. The violent habitual proximity of white bodies moulded the space and turned it white.</p>
