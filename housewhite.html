        <p> <b>“Subtle lemony tones. Lemon creamy white. House White appears minimally lime-coloured due to its light green undertone. This pure off-white is therefore not a typical cream colour. Due to the subtle citrus tone, it fits easily into houses of any era. As a wall coating, House White harmonises particularly well with All White for the paintwork. Medium primer tones.”

       <p>If <g>the white that was</g> shaped <g>the white of the here and now</g>, we can assume that <g>the white of the here and now</g> will shape <g>the white that will be</g>. In the words of William Gibson, <i>“the future is already here, it’s just not very evenly distributed”</i>, alluding that the things that will constitute the normal of those living in the future already exist in some form in the today. However,<i> it can also suppose that the processes in the present that "write the future" will be tainted by the same inequalities that exist in the present.</i> <sup>45</sup>Thinking about the future is in some way thinking about technology as the ongoing advances in artificial intelligence (AI), and innovations in technology encompass ever-larger aspects of our modern society.<sup>46</sup> When looking at technology we see similarities with mass media, as it reflects the dominant culture. </p>
     <br>
      <p>Comparable to the naturalisation of white in mass media, the idea of white as default seems to be widespread in technology. In the video game culture whiteness as a norm and white-centric characters is nothing new.<sup>47</sup> More than often the default character when creating an avatar reflects a white normative body. Daz 3D is a 3D software that helps create and position characters in a digital setting. The software is free but the given models are white normative bodies. To be able to create a diverse range of bodies or skin colours, you have to purchase add-ons. This system of white bodies as default setting perpetuates the idea of white as the norm from which the rest is derived.</p>

     <br>
      <p>At the same time, the physicality of the robots themselves reflect our white culture. Many machines are anthropomorphised—that is, made to be human-like to some degree—to facilitate human-machine interaction.<sup>48</sup> Stephen Cave and Kanta Dihal from the University of Cambridge conducted an investigation into search engines and found that all non-abstract results for AI had either Caucasian features or were literally the colour white.<sup>49</sup> They found a lack of diversity in robot morphology and behaviour from the prevalent whiteness of humanoid robots, to the sociolinguistic markers of the chatbots and virtual assistants whiteness, to the whiteness of AI in stock images, films and television. <i>It’s whiteness reproducing whiteness.</i><sup>50</sup> This normalisation of whiteness leads to the whiteness of AI to be considered simply as default and erases the coloured body in the imagined future.</p>
     <br>
      <p>AI learns from the information that is fed into it. A unilateral worldview will create unilateral AI that will continue to perpetuate the power dynamic of our current society. There already exist many cases of biased AI incidents. In 2015 an image-recognition algorithm from google auto-tagged pictures of black people as “gorillas”. The company's solution to the algorithmic racism was to ban “gorilla” as a label, instead of teaching the machine to recognize black people as human.<sup>51</sup> The fact that whiteness has overflowed our technology has immediate consequences. A few examples are facial recognition technologies that target criminal suspects based on skin colour, trained automated risk profiling systems that disproportionately identify Latinx people as illegal immigrants and devised credit scoring algorithms that disproportionately identify black people as risks and prevent them from buying homes, getting loans, or finding jobs.<sup>52</sup></p>

      <p>Ruha Benjamin calls the phenomenon of computational racism the New Jim Code.<sup>53</sup> Similarly to the way whiteness has been encoded into behaviour and law, it is now being built into our technology. In return, this technology comes to represent those in power and perpetuates the creation of things that only serve them. The one-sided representation and understanding of the world is being used to predict, control and shape the future with the use of technology that perpetuates the same system we live in and in the abstractions in computation inherent in data and algorithms lurks the racism that erases identities from our future.<sup>54</sup></p>
