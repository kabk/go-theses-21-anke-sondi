        <p> <i>“Silent friendliness. White in its purest form. If white is to represent its own theme in the room, All White is the right choice. It is a pure white, completely neutral and free of pigments. Use it for the paintwork and ceilings. The wall colours will appear fresher and brighter. All White is a tone from the Modern Neutrals range. White and light primer tones.”

        <br>

        <p>Through the process of expansion, <g>the white of the here and now</g> has become all-encompassing. It's in every room and every corner. It's a whiteness we’ve inherited from <g>the white that was</g> and our colonial history. <g>The white that was</g> cannot be changed but its effect will always remain in the space we navigate and its expansion, even if more subtle in the now, is still on the rise. <i>Whiteness has become our familiar world, the one we know.</i> <sup>14</sup> Because white is so widespread, it becomes impossible to not be affected by it. We all swim in this sea of whiteness, the difference is while some swim with the current, others are being drowned. To be able to fully inhabit this world, you have to show a sameness to the omnipresent whiteness. Familiarity becomes an important key to feeling like you belong. Important parts of this familiarity are inherited, making some bodies more capable of inhabiting this whiteness, while others are bound to fail. <i>The body-at-home</i> becomes the body that is capable of inhabiting whiteness. <sup>15</sup> In this space we navigate, White is the body-at-home and consequently, it is produced as the host of the house.  </p>
      <br>
        <p>As the body-at-home, white has shaped its surrounding to better fit it’s own image, reinforcing the idea of “others” as unfamiliar. <sup>16</sup> <i>Bodies stand out when they are out of place and such standing re-confirms the whiteness of the space.</i> <sup>17</sup> As a host, white welcomes those who are not at home, the others become the guests, <i>but let us not forget that however warmly welcomed, ultimately a guest is expected to return home again.</i> <sup>18</sup>The way that white positions itself within the space transmutes the rest as the other, the non-white. Against this white background, non-white bodies become exposed and framed. </p>
      <br>
        <p>Through its omnipresence white becomes assumed, which renders it natural and in turn invisible. It forms the unnamed background and functions as the norm from which all is derived. This puts <i>white in the privileged position of being able to see without being seen.</i><sup>19</sup> Inevitably this naturalisation of white is also being shaped through language. Against this normative background, others are being marked and named, while white stays unnamed. This process of naming and marking of the others is found within all levels, even within academic discourses. In the example of my higher education facility “The Royal Academy of Art, the Hague” every year fashion students are given an assignment, to create an “ethnic costume”. The definition of ethnic is <i>relating to or characteristic of a large group of people who have the same national, racial, or cultural origins, and who usually speak the same language.</i> <sup>20</sup> However, as Gloria Wekker remarks in her book “White Innocence” (2014) when ethnicity is invoked in those settings, it is “they”, the others, meaning everything except white. <i>As the more powerful member, it is consistently bracketed and thereby invisibilized and installed as the norm.</i> <sup>21</sup> This commodification of the other can seem like a tempting way to render visible those who have been ignored but in a predominantly white institute that has been shaped by the repetitive approximation of the white bodies that inhabit them, the ethnic costume assignment reinforces the normalcy of white. </p>
      <br>
       <p>
         As the body-at-home, White bodies are comfortable as they inhabit spaces that extend their shape, while simultaneously shaping the space to fit them better. <sup>22</sup> Others become guests, framed by white. The body-at-home takes the powerful position of being the representative of the house and the claim of power to talk for the commonality of the inhabitants.<sup>23</sup> </p>

         <p>16 - “Others” here meaning everything except white. “Otherness is the result of a discursive process by which a dominant in-group (“Us,” the Self) constructs one or many dominated out-groups (“Them,” Other) by stigmatizing a difference – real or imagined – presented as a negation of identity and thus a motive for potential discrimination.” Staszak, J. (2020). Other/Otherness. International Encyclopedia of Human Geography, 25-31. doi:10.1016/b978-0-08-102295-5.10204-5
