       <p>In our current society, the primary mean of communication used to reach the vast majority of the general public is mass media.<sup>25</sup> We are constantly exposed to images and informations produced by mass media and it has become central in shaping our way of making sense of the world. Stuart Hall explains this theory in his lecture on media and representation (1997), in which he describes the process of meaning-making through media representation.<sup>26</sup> According to Hall, an event possesses no fixed meaning at the point of occurrence, only through the process of representation in media is meaning given to the event. This means that media is able to create and assign a fixed meaning to an event. Having the ability to generate such meaning can give people the power to shape consumers perception. In a society dependent on mass media, those who have the power over it, hold the power to reshape our perception of the world in their favour. </p>
     <br>
       <p>In the white cube we live in, the body-at-home that took the claim for the universal and the power to talk for the commonality of the inhabitant, holds the power to generate meaning by the use of mass media. In return, the media tends to reflect this white hegemony by perpetually reasserting the naturalisation and dominance of white. Meaning is being created by the habitual exposure of white bodies against those presented as others: stories are being whitewashed and stereotypes are being perpetuated. Whitewashing is <i>the tendency of media to be dominated by white characters, played by white actors, navigating their way through a story that will likely resonate most deeply with white audiences, based on their experiences and worldviews.</i><sup>27</sup> The film industry is notoriously known for this act of whitewashing. In 2017, the live action film remake of the movie Ghost in the Shell was accused of whitewashing. The film is based on an anime of the same name whos protagonist is a Japanese woman named Motoko Kusanagi. In the remaking of the anime into a movie, the role of the protagonist was given to a white American actress, instead of casting a Japanese woman to play the role of a Japanese character.<sup>28</sup> Whitewashing in films can take on multiple forms. It occurs when a story that takes place in a culturally diverse setting only focuses on white characters, when a story about culturally diverse characters is told from the perspective of a white character (with the white character usually being the one saving the day) or when white actors are being cast to play roles that were originally meant for people of different ethnicities. The act of whitewashing erases non-white bodies from our imaginations by only putting the focus on white bodies. Over time, this unilateral representation in the media has narrowed our perception of the world within and outside of the cube. </p>

       <p>The power to generate meaning can also be used to oppress and exploit those who don’t conform to the stream of white. When the others are constructed as different, they come to internalise this <i>otherness</i>.<sup>29</sup> The naturalisation of white bodies and the construction of otherness in media reflects the white gaze: the notion that everything has to be made with white in mind. The white gaze is omnipresent. It represents the idea of looking at white as the highest standard from which all should be measured against and has control over the images that can circulate.<sup>30</sup> To be capable of entering the stream of circulation, one has to conform to the accepted narrative by whitewashing and erasing important aspects of oneself. This reshaping enables easy entry into the white cube. As long as white aesthetic still defines beauty and worth, coloured bodies will be denied or shaped to appeal to a white audience.<sup>31</sup></p>
     <br>
       <p> The notion that one can create without white in mind is difficult to comprehend for the white gaze as it disrupts the idea of white hegemony. When Kendrick Lamar –a black American rapper– stopped a white fan he invited on stage from using a specific word in his lyrics, it became a scandal. The word in question is a racial slur directed at black people who has been reappropriated by the black community. Some people criticized Kendrick Lamar for constantly making use of this word and integrating it in his lyrics while simultaneously expecting his white fans to not make us of it.<sup>32</sup> The thought that the song was not produced with or for his white fans in mind, is a concept that either sparked confusion or outraged in those white fans. The concept that some forms of media and culture are not explicitly produced for a white audience can come across as disrespectful and invalid to the white consumers. This ethnocentricity allows white people the belief that all cultures are for their consumption.<sup>33</sup> The creation of spaces for others, devoid of the white gaze becomes a treat for the maintaining of the status quo and thus a treat against its power over the other. </p>
     <br>
       <p>Mass media as a system of knowledge and power production is a powerful tool for creating meaning. As the more powerful member, white is able to make use of it to look, represent, shape, appropriate, and commodify the bodies in space to make them fit within its own narrow cube. The white gaze becomes a constant companion that influences the bodies and behaviours of those it looks at. </p>
