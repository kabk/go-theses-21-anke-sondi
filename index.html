      <p>To be able to understand the white all around us <a>–the white of the here and now–</a> is to understand <a>the white that was</a> and how it came to occupy the space. In the same process in which my body came to be shaped by the space it inhabited, spaces are also being shaped by the bodies that inhabit them. Spaces are formed by being orientated around some bodies, more than others.<sup>10</sup> For a space to become white it has to be moulded by the repetitive proximity of white bodies. </p> <br>
        <p><a>The white that was operated</a> in a system of expansion and oppression by which the white body came to occupy more spaces. With the expansion came the reshaping of the spaces through the institutionalisation of white bodies, their ideologies, signs and symbols. The spaces this white came to occupy was not given but taken with violence. The bodies that inhabited these spaces were either recruited or discarded. Recruitment meant to make them part of its institution while neglecting those who do not have access.<sup>11</sup> To be part of an institution is to inhabit its buildings and follow its line. <sup>12</sup> </p> <br>
        <p>One of the prevalent signs installed through the expansion is language: not only as a marker of those belonging to the institution and a tool for recruitment but also as a powerful instrument for demarcation. Through a set of grammar of difference, white placed itself as that which others have to be compared to and judged.<sup>13</sup> With the use of language, the self-proclaimed “developed” white classified the world and put itself in the first position, while placing others as below: as second or third. By taking the highest position in the hierarchy it created, <a>the white that was</a> was able to put in place a set of rules and standards that others have to follow if they ever want to be seen as equal. In contrast to the “developed” white, the others become underdeveloped or in the process of becoming developed. As the self-appointed leader, white then feels entitled to impose its help on others, justifying its expansion as charity. </p> <br>
        <p>This is the white we inherited, the accumulation of past actions that have formed the house that built us. Through processes of expansion, recruitment and demarcation, white came to shape the spaces around us and painted it in its own colour. The violent habitual proximity of white bodies moulded the space and turned it white.</p>

      <p> <i>“Silent friendliness. White in its purest form. If white is to represent its own theme in the room, All White is the right choice. It is a pure white, completely neutral and free of pigments. Use it for the paintwork and ceilings. The wall colours will appear fresher and brighter.

      <br>

      <p>Through the process of expansion, <a>the white of the here and now</a> has become all-encompassing. It's in every room and every corner. It's a whiteness we’ve inherited from <a>the white that was</a> and our colonial history. <a>The white that was</a> cannot be changed but its effect will always remain in the space we navigate and its expansion, even if more subtle in the now, is still on the rise. <i>Whiteness has become our familiar world, the one we know.</i> <sup>14</sup> Because white is so widespread, it becomes impossible to not be affected by it. We all swim in this sea of whiteness, the difference is while some swim with the current, others are being drowned. To be able to fully inhabit this world, you have to show a sameness to the omnipresent whiteness. Familiarity becomes an important key to feeling like you belong. Important parts of this familiarity are inherited, making some bodies more capable of inhabiting this whiteness, while others are bound to fail. <i>The body-at-home</i> becomes the body that is capable of inhabiting whiteness. <sup>15</sup> In this space we navigate, White is the body-at-home and consequently, it is produced as the host of the house.  </p>
    <br>
      <p>As the body-at-home, white has shaped its surrounding to better fit it’s own image, reinforcing the idea of “others” as unfamiliar. <sup>16</sup> <i>Bodies stand out when they are out of place and such standing re-confirms the whiteness of the space.</i> <sup>17</sup> As a host, white welcomes those who are not at home, the others become the guests, <i>but let us not forget that however warmly welcomed, ultimately a guest is expected to return home again.</i> <sup>18</sup>The way that white positions itself within the space transmutes the rest as the other, the non-white. Against this white background, non-white bodies become exposed and framed. </p>
    <br>
      <p>Through its omnipresence white becomes assumed, which renders it natural and in turn invisible. It forms the unnamed background and functions as the norm from which all is derived. This puts <i>white in the privileged position of being able to see without being seen.</i><sup>19</sup> Inevitably this naturalisation of white is also being shaped through language. Against this normative background, others are being marked and named, while white stays unnamed. This process of naming and marking of the others is found within all levels, even within academic discourses. In the example of my higher education facility “The Royal Academy of Art, the Hague” every year fashion students are given an assignment, to create an “ethnic costume”. The definition of ethnic is <i>relating to or characteristic of a large group of people who have the same national, racial, or cultural origins, and who usually speak the same language.</i> <sup>20</sup> However, as Gloria Wekker remarks in her book “White Innocence” (2014) when ethnicity is invoked in those settings, it is “they”, the others, meaning everything except white. <i>As the more powerful member, it is consistently bracketed and thereby invisibilized and installed as the norm.</i> <sup>21</sup> This commodification of the other can seem like a tempting way to render visible those who have been ignored but in a predominantly white institute that has been shaped by the repetitive approximation of the white bodies that inhabit them, the ethnic costume assignment reinforces the normalcy of white. </p>
    <br>
     <p>
       As the body-at-home, White bodies are comfortable as they inhabit spaces that extend their shape, while simultaneously shaping the space to fit them better. <sup>22</sup> Others become guests, framed by white. The body-at-home takes the powerful position of being the representative of the house and the claim of power to talk for the commonality of the inhabitants.<sup>23</sup> </p>

     <br>

    <p>In our current society, the primary mean of communication used to reach the vast majority of the general public is mass media.<sup>25</sup> We are constantly exposed to images and informations produced by mass media and it has become central in shaping our way of making sense of the world. Stuart Hall explains this theory in his lecture on media and representation (1997), in which he describes the process of meaning-making through media representation.<sup>26</sup> According to Hall, an event possesses no fixed meaning at the point of occurrence, only through the process of representation in media is meaning given to the event. This means that media is able to create and assign a fixed meaning to an event. Having the ability to generate such meaning can give people the power to shape consumers perception. In a society dependent on mass media, those who have the power over it, hold the power to reshape our perception of the world in their favour. </p>
  <br>
    <p>In the white cube we live in, the body-at-home that took the claim for the universal and the power to talk for the commonality of the inhabitant, holds the power to generate meaning by the use of mass media. In return, the media tends to reflect this white hegemony by perpetually reasserting the naturalisation and dominance of white. Meaning is being created by the habitual exposure of white bodies against those presented as others: stories are being whitewashed and stereotypes are being perpetuated. Whitewashing is <i>the tendency of media to be dominated by white characters, played by white actors, navigating their way through a story that will likely resonate most deeply with white audiences, based on their experiences and worldviews.</i><sup>27</sup> The film industry is notoriously known for this act of whitewashing. In 2017, the live action film remake of the movie Ghost in the Shell was accused of whitewashing. The film is based on an anime of the same name whos protagonist is a Japanese woman named Motoko Kusanagi. In the remaking of the anime into a movie, the role of the protagonist was given to a white American actress, instead of casting a Japanese woman to play the role of a Japanese character.<sup>28</sup> Whitewashing in films can take on multiple forms. It occurs when a story that takes place in a culturally diverse setting only focuses on white characters, when a story about culturally diverse characters is told from the perspective of a white character (with the white character usually being the one saving the day) or when white actors are being cast to play roles that were originally meant for people of different ethnicities. The act of whitewashing erases non-white bodies from our imaginations by only putting the focus on white bodies. Over time, this unilateral representation in the media has narrowed our perception of the world within and outside of the cube. </p>
  <br>
    <img src="Media/ghost.jpg" alt="Ghost in The shell Foto © Paramount Pictures " style="width:100%">
  <br>
    <p>The power to generate meaning can also be used to oppress and exploit those who don’t conform to the stream of white. When the others are constructed as different, they come to internalise this <i>otherness</i>.<sup>29</sup> The naturalisation of white bodies and the construction of otherness in media reflects the white gaze: the notion that everything has to be made with white in mind. The white gaze is omnipresent. It represents the idea of looking at white as the highest standard from which all should be measured against and has control over the images that can circulate.<sup>30</sup> To be capable of entering the stream of circulation, one has to conform to the accepted narrative by whitewashing and erasing important aspects of oneself. This reshaping enables easy entry into the white cube. As long as white aesthetic still defines beauty and worth, coloured bodies will be denied or shaped to appeal to a white audience.<sup>31</sup></p>
  <br>
    <p> The notion that one can create without white in mind is difficult to comprehend for the white gaze as it disrupts the idea of white hegemony. When Kendrick Lamar –a black American rapper– stopped a white fan he invited on stage from using a specific word in his lyrics, it became a scandal. The word in question is a racial slur directed at black people who has been reappropriated by the black community. Some people criticized Kendrick Lamar for constantly making use of this word and integrating it in his lyrics while simultaneously expecting his white fans to not make us of it.<sup>32</sup> The thought that the song was not produced with or for his white fans in mind, is a concept that either sparked confusion or outraged in those white fans. The concept that some forms of media and culture are not explicitly produced for a white audience can come across as disrespectful and invalid to the white consumers. This ethnocentricity allows white people the belief that all cultures are for their consumption.<sup>33</sup> The creation of spaces for others, devoid of the white gaze becomes a treat for the maintaining of the status quo and thus a treat against its power over the other. </p>
  <br>
    <p>Mass media as a system of knowledge and power production is a powerful tool for creating meaning. As the more powerful member, white is able to make use of it to look, represent, shape, appropriate, and commodify the bodies in space to make them fit within its own narrow cube. The white gaze becomes a constant companion that influences the bodies and behaviours of those it looks at. </p>

    <p> <i>“Bright and modern. A fresh creamy white. New White is one of the “Yellow-Based Neutrals” series. It feels a lot fresher than traditional whites. An ideal “white” for interplay with a stronger colour. New White always brings warmth to the room.”
     <br>Adler Wohndesign GmbH </i> <sup>34</sup> </p>

 <br>

   <p>The naturalised, invisible whiteness that has put together a system in place to keep its power, has turned the white cube into a place of comfort for itself. The body-at-home has forgotten or refused to remember how it got put in place. It resides in the comfort of the system it dominates, feeling entitled and deserving of its privilege and advantages. This internalised sense of superiority can turn into fragility when confronted. The mere suggestion that white yields meaning can trigger a range of defensive responses to return to the white comfort.<sup>35</sup> This is what DiAngelo describes as “White Fragility” in her book of the same name. This fragility is a powerful means of racial control.<sup>36</sup></p>
 <br>
   <p><a>The white of the now</a> assumes that differences and prejudices are in the past, that it ended. It’s <a>the white that was</a> not <a>the white of the here and now</a>. <a>The white of the here and now</a> is invested in the myth of sameness.<sup>37</sup> This supposed colourblindness exposes a natural sense of superiority vis-a-vis the coloured body. <a>The white of the here and now</a> –the progressive– assumes that to be equal we need to stop talking about our differences, <i>but if you are different from us, then you are not equal.</i><sup>38</sup></p>
 <br>
   <p>The white progressive living in the white bubble is unable to see or refuses to see that their actions perpetuate the system in which they live in, rendering black bodies invisible and discussions around race more difficult or superfluous by obscuring the system put in place while simultaneously perpetuating it when refusing to be confronted by it. This is what Gloria Wekker calls “white innocence”: Innocence as: not knowing, forgetting, not wanting to know or even rejecting the possibility of knowing –a process where innocence can turn into ignorance–.<sup>39</sup> And a process in which denial also results in never engaging in acknowledging a factual setting. These defence mechanisms are put in place to maintain the status quo. They comfort because to <i>acknowledge the terrorising reality of white is to disrupt the fantasy of whiteness as representing goodness.</i><sup>40</sup> This in return makes it difficult to speak out against the system, as those who speak are silenced or accused of demanding special treatment.<sup>41</sup></p>
 <br>
   <p>In her book, Gloria Wekker chooses the example of Zwarte Piet (the figure of the Black Piet) as a reflection of this white innocence when dealing with the Netherlands, a country that for many of its inhabitants is viewed as an example of progressiveness for countries across the globe.<sup>42</sup> In her deconstruction of Zwarte Piet, Gloria Wekker enables us to see all aspect of this white innocence in action. Zwarte Piet is a beloved folkloric figure in the Netherlands. It's the figure of a blackened man played by a white man or woman. <i>The costume is composed of black face, thick red lips, folded earrings, an afro wig and a colourful Moor’s costume. Zwarte Piets (plural) are the silly black servants accompanying by foot the huge wise old white bishop Sinterklaas (singular) riding on a horse bringing presents to children.</i><sup>43</sup> Over time the figure of the Black Piet came to be seen by many as a racist caricature but discussion about Black Piet in the Netherlands often brings out aggressive reactions in white people defending it. </p>
 <br>
   <p>The three main reasons Gloria Wekker names for the refusal to end this tradition is the fear of losing one's culture, the supposed innocence of the celebration and a reversal of the narrative. The fear of losing one's culture is the sense that the Dutch culture should be defended against exterior forces. White –the body-at-home– is feeling a sense of loss and is being triggered by the idea that their culture is being taken away from them by what they perceive as the guests. The supposed innocence stems from the notion that Black Piet is a children figure. Taking away the figure of Black Piet would be to deny children of sweet childhood memories and in return spoiling adults' existing memories. This reflects a white self-image that insists on seeing itself as inherently good. The reversal of the narrative is the statement that Black Piet isn’t a racist caricature and that those who see a problem with him are those who have a problem themselves. This technique of silencing and victim-blaming enables the maintaining of the status quo by leaving white unchecked and reversing the narrative onto the others. These techniques render discussion about the figure of Black Piet more difficult or superfluous. </p>
 <br>
   <p><a>The white of the here and now</a> is invested in the myth of sameness while perpetuating the same system that has always favoured it, because to acknowledge the system requires an openness for change and loss, the disruption of the fantasy of white as innocent and acountability. Instead, white finds comfort in the house it shaped, the walls it painted in its own colours and the stories it tells itself because it doesn't hurt. </p>

    <p> <i>“Subtle lemony tones. Lemon creamy white. House White appears minimally lime-coloured due to its light green undertone. This pure off-white is therefore not a typical cream colour. Due to the subtle citrus tone, it fits easily into houses of any era. As a wall coating, House White harmonises particularly well with All White for the paintwork. Medium primer tones.”

   <p>If <a>the white that was</a> shaped <a>the white of the here and now</a>, we can assume that <a>the white of the here and now</a> will shape <a>the white that will be</a>. In the words of William Gibson, <i>“the future is already here, it’s just not very evenly distributed”</i>, alluding that the things that will constitute the normal of those living in the future already exist in some form in the today. However,<i> it can also suppose that the processes in the present that "write the future" will be tainted by the same inequalities that exist in the present.</i> <sup>45</sup>Thinking about the future is in some way thinking about technology as the ongoing advances in artificial intelligence (AI), and innovations in technology encompass ever-larger aspects of our modern society.<sup>46</sup> When looking at technology we see similarities with mass media, as it reflects the dominant culture. </p>
 <br>
  <p>Comparable to the naturalisation of white in mass media, the idea of white as default seems to be widespread in technology. In the video game culture whiteness as a norm and white-centric characters is nothing new.<sup>47</sup> More than often the default character when creating an avatar reflects a white normative body. Daz 3D is a 3D software that helps create and position characters in a digital setting. The software is free but the given models are white normative bodies. To be able to create a diverse range of bodies or skin colours, you have to purchase add-ons. This system of white bodies as default setting perpetuates the idea of white as the norm from which the rest is derived.</p>

 <br>
  <p>At the same time, the physicality of the robots themselves reflect our white culture. Many machines are anthropomorphised—that is, made to be human-like to some degree—to facilitate human-machine interaction.<sup>48</sup> Stephen Cave and Kanta Dihal from the University of Cambridge conducted an investigation into search engines and found that all non-abstract results for AI had either Caucasian features or were literally the colour white.<sup>49</sup> They found a lack of diversity in robot morphology and behaviour from the prevalent whiteness of humanoid robots, to the sociolinguistic markers of the chatbots and virtual assistants whiteness, to the whiteness of AI in stock images, films and television. <i>It’s whiteness reproducing whiteness.</i><sup>50</sup> This normalisation of whiteness leads to the whiteness of AI to be considered simply as default and erases the coloured body in the imagined future.</p>
 <br>
  <p>AI learns from the information that is fed into it. A unilateral worldview will create unilateral AI that will continue to perpetuate the power dynamic of our current society. There already exist many cases of biased AI incidents. In 2015 an image-recognition algorithm from google auto-tagged pictures of black people as “gorillas”. The company's solution to the algorithmic racism was to ban “gorilla” as a label, instead of teaching the machine to recognize black people as human.<sup>51</sup> The fact that whiteness has overflowed our technology has immediate consequences. A few examples are facial recognition technologies that target criminal suspects based on skin colour, trained automated risk profiling systems that disproportionately identify Latinx people as illegal immigrants and devised credit scoring algorithms that disproportionately identify black people as risks and prevent them from buying homes, getting loans, or finding jobs.<sup>52</sup></p>
 <br>
  <p>Ruha Benjamin calls the phenomenon of computational racism the New Jim Code.<sup>53</sup> Similarly to the way whiteness has been encoded into behaviour and law, it is now being built into our technology. In return, this technology comes to represent those in power and perpetuates the creation of things that only serve them. The one-sided representation and understanding of the world is being used to predict, control and shape the future with the use of technology that perpetuates the same system we live in and in the abstractions in computation inherent in data and algorithms lurks the racism that erases identities from our future.<sup>54</sup></p>
