        <p>I’ve been scratching now for months and my fingers start to hurt. I take a step back and contemplate what I have done. Gazing at the wall, it suddenly feels different, less imposing. The structure is still standing but it weakened. The marks I have left behind have created indents and dust is scattered all around the scene. </p>
        <br>
        <p>As I look at this white, a white we inherited from <g>the white that was</g> and our colonial history, I recognize the structures put in place to maintain the status quo. <g>The white of the here and now</g> turned into the body-at-home through familiarity whilst the others became guests, framed by white. As the body-at-home, white then took the claim for the universal and the power to talk for the commonality of the inhabitants. To reinforce its position, white makes use of media as a tool for creating and shaping meaning in its favour.  It’s able to use it to look, represent, shape, appropriate, and commodify the bodies in space and mold them to fit its narrow cube. <g>The white of the here and now</g> is unable to see or refuses to see that their current actions keep on perpetuating a system that only favours them. To truly acknowledge the system would require an openness for change and loss, a disruption of the fantasy of white as innocent and accountability. Instead white chooses to reside in the comfort of the house because it doesn’t hurt. This unilateral representation and understanding of the world has become so naturalised that it is being used to predict, control and shape the future with the use of technologies that perpetuates the same system we live in. It’s whiteness reproducing whiteness.
       </p>
       <br>
       <p>Many artists and thinkers trying to navigate this white cube have constructed ways to disrupt the smooth surface of this whiteness. This act of disobedience towards the body-at-home helps to reinstate and redefine the non-white bodies in spaces. Every attempt produces marks on the structure which weakens it. These artists seek to create places where multiple identities can flourish by imposing their bodies in space, reversing the white gaze and being unapologetic for their skin colour and ethnicities. Their actions mark the way for a future of true hybridity.</p>
       <br>
       <p>I’ve questioned if by writing about whiteness I was not engaging in the same narrative that focuses on whiteness at the expanse of marginalised groups. I’m aware that by focusing on whiteness, I’m putting it again in the centre of it all. However, in order to dismantle or challenge the categories that are made invisible through privilege, we are bound to participate in its critique.65 To be able to talk about what we can do to whiteness and how we can find ways to reshape a system that only favours them, it’s important to understand what whiteness does to us. Only when white is being seen and named can it be disrupted. </p>
       <br>
       <p>This is not the end, nor is it the beginning. The indents and traces left behind have shown me that I’m capable of making changes, even if those appear small against this structure. My scratches merge with the existing marks left behind by those who were here before and those who are still to come. The patterns created by those scratches signify hope for change. My body is slowly unlearning the omnipresent rules, as I explore new ways of navigating in the space. My work is ongoing, the journey has no end. The more I scratch the freer I become and so I scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch...</p>
