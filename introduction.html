          <i>In the nothing of white, we see a lot.</i><sup>2</sup> </p>
        <br>
        <p>As the door closes behind me, I find myself standing in this vast sea of nothingness.<sup>3</sup> It looks so polished, almost slippery. At first, I don’t dare to move, I try to make sure that my shoes are clean enough to leave no traces behind. When I finally feel confident enough I immerse myself into the space, once step after the other, like a careful calculation. The more I venture myself into the space, the smaller I become. I’m unsure if the room is gaining in volume or if I’m reaching into myself. As I walk the emptiness dictates my movements, yet with every step I make I become less and less comfortable. My presence feels out of place and my body alienating. Even so, there is no turning back now, I’m set on my way.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On my destination towards the uncertainty, I sense that I am not alone. I can feel that I’m being watched as if a ghost is following me around to make sure I stay on the right path: the path towards the light. I try to blend in, to follow the invisible rules omnipresent in the air. With time my body orients itself to the rhythm of the nothingness. My walk, my speech, my thoughts they mutate, slowly morphing into something new and yet so familiar. It almost feels natural. I venture myself deeper and deeper into the void until the brightness overwhelms me. I’m hoping that now I won’t be so visible anymore. However as the light bounces from side to side, my body acts as an obstacle that impales it on its perfect path and the ghost, it won’t stop following me. I’ve reached now what seems to be a wall. At first, I assumed that I’ve arrived at the end but maybe it’s just the beginning, I can’t tell anymore. Fortunately, my eyes have started to adapt over time and I’m able to recognise patterns in the vacuum, able to navigate better. This void is not empty, I can see others. We are all in here, we’ve always been here. Some wandering aimlessly, some perfectly blending into the environment and some others trying to escape this big white cube, with its big white walls and its big white sky. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The white I’m talking about here is not <a>the white that was</a>.<sup>4</sup> It’s <a>the white of the here and now</a>, <i>the point from which the world unfolds, which is also the point of inheritance.</i><sup>5</sup> A room painted white, is rarely described as such because white is not seen as a colour and therefore not described as one. In this process white becomes invisible. It’s hard to define something so present but at the same time so transparent. Technically white is the absence of colour but as a light, it’s the reflection of all, the bending of all colours: <i>A compelling paradox of a white that needs always to be everything and nothing, literally overwhelmingly present and yet apparently absent.</i><sup>6</sup> Pure white is the absence of colour in the strictest sense of the definition because you can’t mix colours to create it. However, when you examine the pigment chemistry of white, ground-up substances are used to create the many nuances of white. This white is then reproduced in all parts of our modern society and its presence has an agency. This is the white I want to talk about, the fabricated white with its many nuances to comprehend how it came to define the house we live in. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Standing here in such an approximation to the wall, I feel the urge to touch it. I want to make sense of this <i>white that reproduces itself regardless of intention, power differences and goodwill, and overwhelm­ingly because it is not seen as white.</i>8 I want to touch it, to feel and understand it. I want to disrupt it. I reach to the wall, I scratch its surface until I manage to remove parts of it, small particles of a white powder gliding through my fingers. A little mark on an imposing structure, barely something to make a difference but enough to get a warning as the ghost behind me starts screaming “If you don’t like it here, you can just leave”. I’m perplexed, I’m unaware of the possibility to exit that which infused itself in all aspects of our being. There is no escaping this whiteness, no running away or hiding from it. All there seems to be is to continue scratching –like many others have done before– until we‘ve put enough marks onto its structure that it falls, opening up to new ways of becoming. Disobeying the rules by cracking the wall and disrupting the smooth surface gives leeway for an entry point and so I scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch...</p>
