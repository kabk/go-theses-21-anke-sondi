            From the moment you are born, you enter a system already defined and put in place by those who came before you. Since the beginning, you are taught the rules and ways of being in order to strive within this system. When I entered this world, born in a “former” colony of France, from a father born and raised in Germany, western society as a system and its ideologies has always been part of my construction.
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            In this thesis, western society takes on the form of a house: a house with the promise of hybridity and equality that in my opinion has yet to be reached. In this house, white remains ascendant while the others –the non-white– struggle to establish their place. Through this arises the importance to talk about “White” as a race or non-race, as a colour or the lack thereof, as invisible but at the same time representative of all. How can we achieve true hybridity without white supremacy?
          </p> <br>
          <p>
            This thesis is a deconstruction of the house as an act of marking: making the invisible visible. It’s an exploration of the many nuances of white that define the foundation of the house. I start by identifying the processes that have transformed the house into a place of comfort for white by looking at its violent expansion and how it became naturalised. I will then proceed to identify the methods used to reinforce the status quo including the use of mass media, an array of defence mechanisms that render discussion about race difficult and superfluous and technologies that erase non-white bodies from our imagined future.
          </p>
        </div> <br>
          <p>
            Parallel to this deconstruction of white, this thesis explores the act of disobedience: The disruption of whiteness and the system put in place through the lens of artists that have aimed to do just that. This part is about reclaiming the space and transforming it into a place where multiple identities and non-white bodies can flourish. By confronting the status quo with works that refuse to be part of it, this thesis takes you on a journey of learning and unlearning. The aim is to identify the status quo in order to move away from it and facilitate the designing of a future of true hybridity without white supremacy.

                                                          <p>
                                                            <i>In the nothing of white, we see a lot.</i><sup>2</sup> </p>
                                                          <br>
                                                          <p>As the door closes behind me, I find myself standing in this vast sea of nothingness.<sup>3</sup> It looks so polished, almost slippery. At first, I don’t dare to move, I try to make sure that my shoes are clean enough to leave no traces behind. When I finally feel confident enough I immerse myself into the space, once step after the other, like a careful calculation. The more I venture myself into the space, the smaller I become. I’m unsure if the room is gaining in volume or if I’m reaching into myself. As I walk the emptiness dictates my movements, yet with every step I make I become less and less comfortable. My presence feels out of place and my body alienating. Even so, there is no turning back now, I’m set on my way.</p>
                                                          <br>
                                                          <p>On my destination towards the uncertainty, I sense that I am not alone. I can feel that I’m being watched as if a ghost is following me around to make sure I stay on the right path: the path towards the light. I try to blend in, to follow the invisible rules omnipresent in the air. With time my body orients itself to the rhythm of the nothingness. My walk, my speech, my thoughts they mutate, slowly morphing into something new and yet so familiar. It almost feels natural. I venture myself deeper and deeper into the void until the brightness overwhelms me. I’m hoping that now I won’t be so visible anymore. However as the light bounces from side to side, my body acts as an obstacle that impales it on its perfect path and the ghost, it won’t stop following me. I’ve reached now what seems to be a wall. At first, I assumed that I’ve arrived at the end but maybe it’s just the beginning, I can’t tell anymore. Fortunately, my eyes have started to adapt over time and I’m able to recognise patterns in the vacuum, able to navigate better. This void is not empty, I can see others. We are all in here, we’ve always been here. Some wandering aimlessly, some perfectly blending into the environment and some others trying to escape this big white cube, with its big white walls and its big white sky. </p>
                                                          <br>
                                                          <p>The white I’m talking about here is not <a>the white that was</a>.<sup>4</sup> It’s <a>the white of the here and now</a>, <i>the point from which the world unfolds, which is also the point of inheritance.</i><sup>5</sup> A room painted white, is rarely described as such because white is not seen as a colour and therefore not described as one. In this process white becomes invisible. It’s hard to define something so present but at the same time so transparent. Technically white is the absence of colour but as a light, it’s the reflection of all, the bending of all colours: <i>A compelling paradox of a white that needs always to be everything and nothing, literally overwhelmingly present and yet apparently absent.</i><sup>6</sup> Pure white is the absence of colour in the strictest sense of the definition because you can’t mix colours to create it. However, when you examine the pigment chemistry of white, ground-up substances are used to create the many nuances of white. This white is then reproduced in all parts of our modern society and its presence has an agency. This is the white I want to talk about, the fabricated white with its many nuances to comprehend how it came to define the house we live in. </p>
                                                          <br>
                                                          <p>Standing here in such an approximation to the wall, I feel the urge to touch it. I want to make sense of this <i>white that reproduces itself regardless of intention, power differences and goodwill, and overwhelm­ingly because it is not seen as white.</i>8 I want to touch it, to feel and understand it. I want to disrupt it. I reach to the wall, I scratch its surface until I manage to remove parts of it, small particles of a white powder gliding through my fingers. A little mark on an imposing structure, barely something to make a difference but enough to get a warning as the ghost behind me starts screaming “If you don’t like it here, you can just leave”. I’m perplexed, I’m unaware of the possibility to exit that which infused itself in all aspects of our being. There is no escaping this whiteness, no running away or hiding from it. All there seems to be is to continue scratching –like many others have done before– until we‘ve put enough marks onto its structure that it falls, opening up to new ways of becoming. Disobeying the rules by cracking the wall and disrupting the smooth surface gives leeway for an entry point and so I scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch...</p>

Gazing at the wall, it suddenly feels different, less imposing. The structure is still standing but it weakened. The marks I have left behind have created indents and dust is scattered all around the scene. </p>
                                                                    <br>
                                                                    <p>As I look at this white, a white we inherited from <g>the white that was</g> and our colonial history, I recognize the structures put in place to maintain the status quo. <g>The white of the here and now</g> turned into the body-at-home through familiarity whilst the others became guests, framed by white. As the body-at-home, white then took the claim for the universal and the power to talk for the commonality of the inhabitants. To reinforce its position, white makes use of media as a tool for creating and shaping meaning in its favour.  It’s able to use it to look, represent, shape, appropriate, and commodify the bodies in space and mold them to fit its narrow cube. <g>The white of the here and now</g> is unable to see or refuses to see that their current actions keep on perpetuating a system that only favours them. To truly acknowledge the system would require an openness for change and loss, a disruption of the fantasy of white as innocent and accountability. Instead white chooses to reside in the comfort of the house because it doesn’t hurt. This unilateral representation and understanding of the world has become so naturalised that it is being used to predict, control and shape the future with the use of technologies that perpetuates the same system we live in. It’s whiteness reproducing whiteness.
                                                                   </p>
                                                                   <br>
                                                                   <p>Many artists and thinkers trying to navigate this white cube have constructed ways to disrupt the smooth surface of this whiteness. This act of disobedience towards the body-at-home helps to reinstate and redefine the non-white bodies in spaces. Every attempt produces marks on the structure which weakens it. These artists seek to create places where multiple identities can flourish by imposing their bodies in space, reversing the white gaze and being unapologetic for their skin colour and ethnicities. Their actions mark the way for a future of true hybridity.</p>
                                                                   <br>
                                                                   <p>I’ve questioned if by writing about whiteness I was not engaging in the same narrative that focuses on whiteness at the expanse of marginalised groups. I’m aware that by focusing on whiteness, I’m putting it again in the centre of it all. However, in order to dismantle or challenge the categories that are made invisible through privilege, we are bound to participate in its critique.65 To be able to talk about what we can do to whiteness and how we can find ways to reshape a system that only favours them, it’s important to understand what whiteness does to us. Only when white is being seen and named can it be disrupted. </p>

The indents and traces left behind have shown me that I’m capable of making changes, even if those appear small against this structure. My scratches merge with the existing marks left behind by those who were here before and those who are still to come. The patterns created by those scratches signify hope for change. My body is slowly unlearning the omnipresent rules, as I explore new ways of navigating in the space. My work is ongoing, the journey has no end. The more I scratch the freer I become and so I scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch, and scratch...</p>
